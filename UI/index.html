          Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe
          acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified
          in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the
          COVID-19 pandemic. Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever,cough,
          headache,fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.Symptoms may
          begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are
          infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.Of those people who develop symptoms
          noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms
          (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnoea, hypoxia, or more than
          50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure,
          shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe
          symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months
          after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.Multi-year studies are underway to
          further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new respiratory illness first identified during an
            investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China, but has now spread to other parts of the
            world, including the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2 and is spread between people who are
            in close contact with each other (within about six feet), mostly through respiratory
            droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
          </p>
          <p>
            People are thought to be most contagious when they are the sickest (symptomatic);
            however, growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 may be spread by people before they
            start showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) or by people who have the virus but never show
            symptoms (asymptomatic). The virus can also live on certain surfaces for a period of
            time which can make it possible for people to get COVID-19 if they touch a contaminated
            object and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes. That is why it is important to take
            preventive steps to avoid getting sick.

        <button class="collapsible">what are the symptons?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Some people who get COVID-19 may be asymptomatic but for those experiencing symptoms,
            the following, varying from mild to severe, may appear 2-14 days after exposure:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Cough</li>

            <li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
            <li>Body aches</li>

            Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, if you are
            sick with COVID-19 or start experiencing its symptoms, follow these steps:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Stay home:</span> Most people with COVID-19 get a mild form of the illness that
            may include fever, coughing, and other symptoms listed above. People with mild symptoms
            can usually get better at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to
            get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Stay in touch with your doctor: </span> Call your doctor before going to their
            office. If you do not have a regular doctor, call your local health department or
            hospital to find out where you can go to seek medical care. Be sure to get care
            immediately if you have trouble breathing, since that is a more serious symptom, or if
            you have any emergency warning signs, or think it is an emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Avoid public transportation:</span> Avoid using public transportation, ride
            sharing, or taxis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Cover your coughs and sneezes</span>: Cover your cough or sneezes with a tissue
            and throw away the tissue in a lined trash. Immediately wash your hands for at least 20
            seconds with soap and water or use hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol if soap
            and water are not available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Clean your hands often:</span> Wash your hands with soap and water often. Only use
            hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Wear a cloth mask or covering:</span> If you are sick and you must be around
            others even at home, wear a cloth mask or face covering over your nose and mouth.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Anyone, no matter their age, can become sick with COVID-19. However, older adults (over
            65 years of age) and people with compromised immune systems or chronic conditions, such
            as diabetes and lung disease, may be at higher risk for developing more serious symptoms
            or complications from COVID-19. If you or your loved ones are at higher risk, stay home
            as much as possible, consult with your doctor about additional steps to take to protect
            yourself and follow these prevention measures to decrease your risk of getting sick with
            COVID-19:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ensure you have enough food at home and that your prescriptions are refilled and up to
              date. Avoid large crowds.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid nonessential travel.</li>
